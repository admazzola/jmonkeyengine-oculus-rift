Add the oculuslib.jar to the project.

Run TestStereoCam.java to see a full example of how to set up an application to use the oculus rift.
TestGui shows gui in stereo (no code needed).



Adding oculus rift support to your application.

1. To simply get the stereo cams and barrel distortion (no controls):

<code language="java">
StereoCamAppState stereoCamAppState = new StereoCamAppState();
stateManager.attach(stereoCamAppState);
</code>

2. To add basic HMD sensing:

<code language="java">
Spatial observer = new Node("Observer");
observer.addControl(stereoCamAppState.getCameraControl());
rootNode.attachChild(observer);
</code>

~~Since revision 27, you now also need to initialize the rift in a static context:~~
<code language="java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
OculusRiftReader.initialize();
MyApp app = new MyApp();
app.start();
}
</code>
~~This has to happen before instantiating the application.~~
~~This is NOT IDEAL and is likely to change in the future.~~

This seems to be resolved in revision 34.
