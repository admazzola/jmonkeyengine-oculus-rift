#summary How to use this project

= Details =

See TestStereoCam.java to see a full example of how to set up an application to use the oculus rift.

TestGui shows gui in stereo (no code needed).

Adding oculus rift support to your application:

1. Add the latest jna-x.x.x, jovr-0.x.x.x, guava-x.x.jar & JMonkeyOculusRift.jar to the project.

2. To simply get the stereo cams and barrel distortion (no controls):

<code language="java">
OVRAppState ovrAppState = new OVRAppState();
stateManager.attach(ovrAppState);
</code>

3. To add basic HMD sensing:

<code language="java">
Spatial observer = new Node("Observer");
observer.addControl(ovrAppState.getCameraControl());
rootNode.attachChild(observer);
</code>

~~Since revision 27, you now also need to initialize the rift in a static context:~~
<code language="java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
OculusRift.initialize();
MyApp app = new MyApp();
app.start();
}
</code>
~~This has to happen before instantiating the application.~~
~~This is NOT IDEAL and is likely to change in the future.~~

This seems to be resolved in revision 34.
